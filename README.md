# Ciao! 👋

## 📓 About me

Born in [Tivoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoli,_Lazio), a small historic town near Rome (Italy). I later moved to New York, and now in San Francisco.

- My grandfather used to own a computer store, and I have been around tech goodness since I was 3 years old.
- My grandmother used to own a news booth, she would get me the coolest video games magazines.
- I got my first part-time job at a publishing house for a video games magazine.
- A magazine about [Macromedia Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) got me into web development.

Started with design, got curious about back-end, found the sweet spot in between.  
Today, I love **bridging the gap between design and development**.

## 💼 Work
